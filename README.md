# FitCode – Web Application (Frontend Contribution)

## Overview
FitCode is a web-based health and nutrition tracking application developed as a team project.

The system allows users to register, calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI), estimate daily calorie needs, and track nutrition-related data. The application is designed to support healthy lifestyle management through user data input and personalized calculations.

This repository represents my frontend implementation and integration work.

## My Role in the Project
I was responsible for the frontend development of the application, including:

- Designing and implementing the user interface (HTML & CSS)
- Developing client-side functionality using JavaScript
- Implementing form handling and validation
- Managing asynchronous communication with the backend (Fetch API)
- Connecting the registration system to backend endpoints

Backend architecture, requirement analysis, and system design were developed by other team members.
